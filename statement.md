# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Small to medium-sized retail businesses often struggle with manual inventory tracking methods, such as paper records or spreadsheets. These manual processes are prone to human error, data redundancy, and inefficiency, leading to stock discrepancies, overstocking, or stockouts. There is a need for a digitized, automated solution to streamline stock management and provide real-time visibility into inventory levels.

## Scope of the Project
The **Inventory Management System** is a desktop-based application designed to digitize the tracking of goods and supplies.
* **In Scope:**
    * Management of product details (names, prices, categories).
    * Tracking current stock levels and updating them upon sales or purchases.
    * Management of supplier and customer information.
    * Generation of transaction records or bills.
    * Secure access through user authentication.
* **Out of Scope:**
    * E-commerce integration or online payment gateway processing.
    * Complex predictive analytics for demand forecasting.

## Target Users
* **Store Administrators/Owners:** To oversee total inventory, manage user access, and view sales reports.
* **Warehouse/Shop Staff:** To enter daily stock updates, record sales, and check product availability.
* **Suppliers:** (Indirectly) Beneficiaries of accurate order management.

## High-Level Features
1.  **User Authentication:** Secure login module to differentiate between administrators and standard users (Staff).
2.  **Product Management (CRUD):** Ability to Add, View, Update, and Delete product records.
3.  **Stock Control:** Real-time updates of quantity-on-hand when items are purchased or sold.
4.  **Supplier & Customer Management:** Database to store and retrieve contact details for suppliers and customers.
5.  **Billing & Reporting:** Generation of simple invoices or stock status reports.
